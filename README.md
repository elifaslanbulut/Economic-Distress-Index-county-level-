# Economic-Distress-Index-county-level-

##This repository showcases the collaborative effort between @knu2xs and @elifaslanbulut in creating an economic distress index layer from Census data using Python in ArcGIS. 
We create teh index using 2017-2021 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates and share the feature layer to ArcGIS Online where you can take advantage of Smart Mapping, Instant Apps and ArcGIS Dashboards to share insights derived from this data.
